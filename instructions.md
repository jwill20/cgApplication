# CGApp Application Exercise Instructions
## Overall Objective
Create a Node.js based application that manages chatbot information via a REST API.

## Instructions
Create a Node.js REST API that implements the following functions. Endpoint names can be whatever you choose but you will get extra credit
for having names that follow best practices. 
1. Get all bots and print to the console all the bot information
2. Get one bot and print to the console information about that particular bot
3. Add a new bot
4. Update a bot
5. Delete a bot

bots.json contains the initial data for the bots. You can copy this into your code, but you will get extra credit for reading it in when 
your application starts.

Clone this repo - https://github.com/jwill20/cgApplication - and create a new github repo for your code.  Send us a link to your new repo as soon as you create it.  You will have 24 hours to complete the exercise.

## Where is the bot data?
bots.json contains the initial data for the bots

## How do I run the code?
You can use Postman or curl or any other tool that you are familiar with to exercise your endpoints

## Where is the repo?
https://github.com/jwill20/cgApplication

## How can I get extra credit?
- Create Mocha test cases for your API
- Write a front-end to test your application
- Assume that the bots.json data is in the Azure KeyVault. Read the data from there when your application starts.
- Assume that the bots.json data is in a Mongo or MySQL DB. Read the data from there when your application starts.
